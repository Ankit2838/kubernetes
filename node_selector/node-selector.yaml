# node-selector: is a strict rule and labls are applied to nodes 
# if a pod is haivng node-slector in spec section of deployment only then pod will be schedule to that node otherwise it wont schedule to that node as well as other nodes too
#Affinity: with ad=ffinity we define that a particular node will mount to that node but if it wont find the node than it will schedule onto other node
